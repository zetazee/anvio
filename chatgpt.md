# set your chatgpt right

two things will make your life easier in this course:

- your system
- your chatgpt

iâ€™ve mentioned the system on the [anvio installation page](https://zetazee.github.io/anvio/installation.html), but for chatgpt, configure it in a way that it will provide you with personal and precise responses.

i suggest you purchase a subscription to have access to more features and models. this is just a suggestion and money well-spent. but with the free version you also can get things done.

# create a project for anvio

instruct it the way you need.

you can open a new conversation every time and it will remember how to answer your questions and you can add or remove things from the instruction to adjust your needs anytime.
