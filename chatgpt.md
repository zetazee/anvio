# set your chatgpt right

two things will make your life easier in this course:

- your system
- your chatgpt

iâ€™ve mentioned the system on the [anvio installation page](https://zetazee.github.io/anvio/installation.html), but for chatgpt, configure it in a way that it will provide you with personal and precise responses.

you will learn things the best if you actively spend time doing them and chatgpt is the perfect partner and teacher for you. that is why i suggest you purchase a subscription to have access to more features and models. this is just a suggestion and money well-spent. but with the free version you also can get things done.

with the plus version you can define projects, where you instruct it on how to answer you.

# create a project for anvio

instruct it the way you need.

you can open a new conversation everyday and it will remember how to answer your questions and you can add or remove things from the instruction to adjust your needs anytime.
