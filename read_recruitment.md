# read recruitment
read here means short pieces of dna, and recruitment here means matching similar short pieces together. itâ€™s like you have a job (a genome), and people (reads) get recruited for it!  
so, if we have a genome and want to see if it, as a whole or in parts, exists in our sample, we use this technique.
