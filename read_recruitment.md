# read recruitment
read here means short pieces of dna, and recruitment here means matching similar short pieces together. itâ€™s like you have a job (a genome), and people (reads) get recruited for it! so, if we have a genome and want to see if it, as a whole or in parts, exists in our sample, we use this technique.  

please visit [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqD4aN1p1qA) to fully grasp the idea.

before starting the turorial, here is a glossary that you might find useful:

  Determining the precise order of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA.
  - Sanger sequencing (first generation)
  - Next generation sequencing (NGS)
  - Third gen (Oxford Nanopore, PacBio SMRT)

  <summary>reference sequence</summary>
  - a sequence that serves as the base for comparing and aligning other sequences.
  - anything that is longer than your shorts may serve as a reference.
